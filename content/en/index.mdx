# Calculate earnings

{/* c:calculateearnings.description */}

Do you have excess server capacity with considerable upload bandwidth and storage capacity?

We're looking for node operators to participate in the Filecoin Saturn network. <b>The earlier you join, the more Filecoin (FIL) you’ll earn!</b>

{/* c:calculateearnings.input */}

export const calculatorInformation = [
    {usdText: "USD", filText: "FIL", perMonthText: "Monthly Earnings", or: "or"},
    {percentage:false, average:false, label:'Available upload capacity (Gbps)' , minValue:10 , maxValue:1000 , startValue:10, averageText: "Average"},
    {maxLabel:"high" , minLabel:"low" , percentage:true, average:true, label:'Load carried by server*' , minValue:10 , maxValue:90 , startValue:50, averageText: "Average"}

]

{/* c:calculateearnings.footnote */}

*Load is determined by how many nodes with similar server capacity are in your region (competition), and how much content is requested by end-users (demand).

{/* c:what-is-saturn.title */}

# What is Saturn?

{/* c:what-is-saturn.description */}

Saturn is a Web3 CDN in Filecoin’s retrieval market. On one side of the network, websites buy fast, low-cost content delivery. On the other side, Saturn node operators earn Filecoin by fulfilling requests.

Saturn is trustless, permissionless, and inclusive. Anyone can run Saturn software, contribute to the network, and earn Filecoin.

Content on Saturn is [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) content-addressed. Every piece of content is immutable and every response verifiable.

Crypto-incentives unite, align, and grow the network. Node operators earn Filecoin for accelerating web content and websites get faster content delivery for less.

All work is open source and developed in the public for all humanity.
