# How Saturn Works

{/* c:how-saturn-works.description */}
Websites use Saturn by adding a `<script>` tag and Service Worker. Once added, Saturn's Service Worker intercepts requests for content-addressed assets, like <a href="https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPqrxJKR4xuUzcjbAB5KnpmdUnoHPGkWs1XqerSWkgPNa/filecoin-orbit-2.mp4" target="_blank">https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPxJ…</a>, and fulfills them from Saturn. In this manner, content-addressed assets, from JavaScript to videos, are accelerated.

Saturn nodes don't respond with files but instead IPLD <a href="https://ipld.io/specs/transport/car/" target="_blank">CAR files</a>. These CAR files are incrementally verified by Saturn's Service Worker, as they're received, to prevent abuse and allow for a trustless network.

Saturn's network is comprised of three node types:

- <b>Network edge nodes (L1s)</b>: High bandwidth servers with large caches close to users.
- <b>Intermediate cache nodes (L2s)</b>: Desktops running Windows, Linux, and OS X and smaller servers.
- Content backbone nodes: Filecoin <a href="https://sp.filecoin.io/" target="_blank">Storage Providers</a> (SPs).

With these, the network flow of a Saturn request is:

 1. A browser requests an asset from the nearest L1
 2. The L1 cache misses to its surrounding swarm of L2s
 3. L2s cache miss to SPs

After a request is fulfilled -- completely or partially -- the website pays the network in Filecoin for fulfilling the retrieval. And every L1, L2, and SP node that participated in the retrieval is remunerated for their contribution in fulfilling that request.
