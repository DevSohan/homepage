We're looking for early node operators to run L1 nodes and earn Filecoin when Saturn enter private beta. Do you have server capacity with considerable uplink and storage and want to get in early? If so, please introduce yourself in <a href="https://filecoinproject.slack.com/archives/C03DH0BL02E">#filecoin-saturn</a> on <a href="https://filecoin.io/slack" target="_blank">Filecoin Slack</a>!
