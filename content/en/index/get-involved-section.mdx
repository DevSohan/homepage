We're looking for early node operators to run L1 nodes and earn Filecoin while Saturn is in private beta. Do you have server capacity with considerable uplink and storage and want to get in early? If so, please introduce yourself in <a href="https://filecoinproject.slack.com/archives/C03DH0BL02E">#filecoin-saturn</a> on <a href="https://filecoin.io/slack" target="_blank">Filecoin Slack</a>!

The Saturn team is also actively hiring full-stack and distributed systems engineers. Want to build an interplanetary, Web3 CDN?
