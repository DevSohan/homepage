# Get involved

Saturn is open source software and developed in the open. We'd love for you to join us.

We're looking for early node operators to run L1 nodes and earn Filecoin while Saturn is in private beta. Do you have server capacity available, notably upload capacity, and want to get in early? If so, please introduce yourself in [#filecoin-saturn](https://filecoinproject.slack.com/archives/C03DH0BL02E) on [Filecoin Slack](https://filecoinproject.slack.com/)!

The Saturn team is also actively hiring full-stack developers and distributed systems engineers. Want to build an interplanetary, Web3 CDN?

You can also follow along with Saturn's active development on [GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Afilecoin-project+saturn), [Slack](https://filecoinproject.slack.com/archives/C03DH0BL02E), and [Notion](https://www.notion.so/pl-strflt/Filecoin-Saturn-efc122f123f344ff8ff0de6071954dba).
